// instructions for generating the catalog
1. Run the tdat2json utility for all targets you want to import. Run without command line arguments to
show which targets are available. Make sure to get the class list.

2. Run the vizier2json utility for any targets you want that are not available via the HEASARC. Run
without arguments to show which ones are available.

3. Using mongoimport, import the files into a single collection named catalog, excluding class (sample below):

    mongoimport -d astro -c catalog <file>.json

4. Import class into a separate collection (it will be a DBRef):

    mongoimport -d astro -c class class.json

5. Run the javascript in the createCatalog.txt file. (It's in a txt file because of a bug in IDEA with
.js files)

6. Each catalog should have a specific file for java script that needs to be run on them. Open it an run
the scripts for the first pass only.

7. Run the javascript in the postprocess.txt file.

At this point, the second pass of processing should begin.

8. Import the catalogs to their own collections. Example:

    mongoimport -d astro -c hd hd.json
