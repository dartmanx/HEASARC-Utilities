// instructions for generating the catalog
1. Run the tdat2json utility for all targets you want to import. Run without command line arguments to
show which targets are available. Make sure to get the class list.
2. Run the vizier2json utility for any targets you want that are not available via the HEASARC. Run
without arguments to show which ones are available.
3. Using mongoimport, import the files into a single collection named catalog (sample below):

    mongoimport -d astro -c catalog <file>.json

4. Run the javascript in the createCatalog.txt file. (It's in a txt file because of a bug in IDEA with
.js files)

5. Import the catalogs to their own collections. Example:

    mongoimport -d astro -c hd hd.json

6. Run the catalog-specific javascript on them (i.e. hd.txt). Each catalog-specific file is responsible
for generating dbref's on both sides of the catalog-(individual) relationship.

7. Run the javascript in the postprocess.txt file.
