This application is similar in concept to my earlier tdat2mysql app, also on Github.

Here's the story behind it. One fine Sunday morning, I'm reading Reddit. I notice something from
/r/programming has actually made it to the front page. The title is "Don't use MongoDB". I was a bit
intrigued and read it.

The author made some valid points, but his points seemed to be related to the 1.8 version of Mongo. The
2.0 supposedly addressed most of them. I realize: if I could use Mongo, I would be able to stop trying
to force the Astronomical Catalogs into a relational format. However, the TDAT files are bang-delineated
and needed to be put in JSON format. Hence this app.

Usage

java -jar tdate2json-0.1-jar (heasarc file) (output directory)

Warning: the file will be big.

To pull the file into MongoDB:

mongoimport --host localhost --db (dbname) --collection (collection name) --file (filename)

Have fun, hope this is of use to someone.
