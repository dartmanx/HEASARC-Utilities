This is a replacement for the old tdat2json and vizier2json utilities. They worked pretty well, but had
some annoyances:

1. Kept having to switch directories to use separate utilities.
2. Different XML config formats

This app is supposed to replace those two command line utilities with a nice GUI-based app, with a
common XML format for configuration.

Initial versions will only output to json format, but eventually I might support other formats.
