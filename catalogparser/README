This is a replacement for the old tdat2json and vizier2json utilities. They worked pretty well, but had
some annoyances:

1. Kept having to switch directories to use separate utilities.
2. Different XML config formats

This app is supposed to replace those two command line utilities with a nice GUI-based app, with a
common XML format for configuration.

Initial versions will only output to json format, but eventually I might support other formats.

XML Format Description:
<catalogs> - top-level tag, no attributes
<catalog> - identifies an individual catalog. Two attributes:
    name - name of catalog (mandatory)
    type - "tdat" for HEASARC files, "dat" for vizier files (mandatory)
<url> - URL of file
<headerUrl> - URL of tdat header file
<fields> - container for <field> elements
<field> - identifies a single field to be imported. Attributes:
    name - name of field (mandatory). For dat files, this can be whatever you want, but TDAT files must
            match the format defined in the TDAT file
    renameTo - what to rename the field to
    keepAfterCopy - whether to keep the original field after it's renamed
    prefix - prefix for a field name (if field was originally only a number)
    start - start index of the field (dat only)
    end - end index of the field (dat only)
