This is a consolidated, multi-module package of all of my code to deal with heasarc files, including:

- CatalogParser - SwingUI based app to replace tdat2json and vizier2json
- TDAT2MYSQL (No longer maintained) - convert TDAT files to SQL with a MySQL flavor
- Tdat2JSON - Convert TDAT files to JSON for use in MongoDB
- vizier2json - Convert files from the vizier catalog library to JSON format for MongoDB
